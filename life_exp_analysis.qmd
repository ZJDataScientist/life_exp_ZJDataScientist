# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Life Expectancy Analysis 

Here is the code to organize the data for analysis

```{r}
lif_exp<- gapminder::gapminder_unfiltered
lif_exp
```

```{r}
sumdat <- lif_exp %>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  filter(lifeExp == max (lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(year,country,lifeExp)%>%
  arrange(year)%>%
  ungroup()%>%

print(sumdat)
         
  
```
